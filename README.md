In order to run this you will need Android Studio 3.0

If you are unable to run this, you may need to set up the virtual devices on your computer.

Click on the Tools tab in Android Studio, way on the top. Then select Android from the pull down menu, then select AVD Manager to see your virtual devices (at this point you have none, so let's create one. When you see a screen that is titled "Select Hardware," choose Nexus 5 in Phone Category List. Click on next.

I believe Android Studio is now only providing 4 options for APIs, so you may click on any release name. To be safe, I would choose the earlier Nougat version (7.0.0)

I also released a video that shows the core functionality of the application if you want to take a look at that!
